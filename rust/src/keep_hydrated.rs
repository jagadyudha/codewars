// Nathan loves cycling.

// Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.

// You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.

// For example:

// time = 3 ----> litres = 1

// time = 6.7---> litres = 3

// time = 11.8--> litres = 5

pub fn keep_hydrated(time: f64) -> i32 {
    let litres: f64 = time * 0.5;
    return litres as i32;
}
